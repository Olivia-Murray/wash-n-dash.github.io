  <li>To become more familiar with designing a project using IntelliJ Idea</li>
  <li>To learn how to implement a multi-user system</li>
  <li>To utilize databases (mongoDB) efficiently</li>

Your index.md file should contain the following sections:

About. Summarizes what the system does and what makes it special and different from other related applications. Provide at least one screen shot of every page. This initial section should provide enough detail for a user to get up and running with your system (you can provide further help within the application itself).

Installation. Explains how to download, install, and (if necessary) deploy the system.

Application design. Explains how the system was designed. See the BowFolios system for details.

Development history. Explains the trajectory of development of the system: what was accomplished during each milestone. See the BowFolios system for details.

Contact Us. Explains who the developers of the system are and how to get in touch with them if you have comments or questions.
