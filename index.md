##what the system should eventually provide

##screenshots of the mockup pages you plan to use as a basis for your final project

For small applications, the organizationâ€™s index.md file should provide all of the required documentation for the system (outside of code-level documentation). Your index.md file should contain the following sections.

About. Summarizes what the system does and what makes it special and different from other related applications. Provide at least one screen shot of every page. This initial section should provide enough detail for a user to get up and running with your system (you can provide further help within the application itself).

Installation. Explains how to download, install, and (if necessary) deploy the system.

Application design. Explains how the system was designed. See the BowFolios system for details.

Development history. Explains the trajectory of development of the system: what was accomplished during each milestone. See the BowFolios system for details.

Contact Us. Explains who the developers of the system are and how to get in touch with them if you have comments or questions.
